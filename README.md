# Collection

A Flutter package save everything widget favorite. This package is entirely written in Dart and supports Android, iOS, Web and Desktop. Also, because of being independent from native platform, it does not increase size of your apps output (e.g. apk).

## Supported platforms

* Flutter Android
* Flutter iOS
* Flutter Web (currently there is a blocking bug in flutter itself)
* Flutter Desktop

## Getting Started

In your `pubspec.yaml` file add:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_widget_collection: any
```
Then, in your code import:
```dart
import 'package:flutter_widget_collection/flutter_widget_collection.dart';
```
